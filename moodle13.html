    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p><b><em>Although knowledge-based industries are bourgeoning across the nation, jobs that require a higher level of skill continue to go up in demand. The education and training industry has been nurturing an inverse relationship between quality of talent and availability, with only three in 19 graduates actually being considered fit for jobs every year.

        KGiSL MicroCollege (KGM) envisions bridging this gaping abyss between skilled resources and the talent-hungry job market by empowering the youth in emerging technologies and life skills required to transform them into career-ready professionals.
        
        At KGM, you are presented with an opportunity to acquire the most in-demand skills in the job market within a matter of months with the support of a team of zealous industry experts.
